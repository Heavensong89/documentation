3. Change directory to the project folder with `cd homarr`.

4. Install the dependencies with `pnpm install`.

5. Start redis by running `pnpm run docker:dev`. This will run a docker-compose file with a redis service.

7. Run the migrations to create the sqlite db file with `pnpm run db:migration:sqlite:run`.

8. Start the development server with `pnpm dev` and wait for a message that says `âœ“ Ready in 10.7s`

9. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). (Loading the page might take up to 2 minutes the first time)
