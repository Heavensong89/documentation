Each dashboard is called a "board".
You can create as many boards as you want.
Boards can be restricted to user groups.
A user may also have a "home board" which they will see at the root path (e.g. my-homarr.com or my-homarr.com/board).
Other boards can be viewed by direct links (e.g. my-homarr.com/board/smart-home) or via the management pages.

## Create a new board

1. Click the button "Create new board" at the top right
2. Enter a name for the board
3. Click on the "Create" button

## Managing and editing boards
To edit and manage a board, click on the big "View board" button.
Only logged-in administrators can edit boards.
To further limit who has access to your board you can use the [board customizations](/docs/advanced/customizations/board-customization).
